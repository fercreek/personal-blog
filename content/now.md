I'm in Monterrey, Nuevo León, learning about cryptocurrencies, investment, and data analytics.

This is what I spend my time doing:

- Writing on my [blog](https://fercontreras.com)
- [Reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/fercreek)
- Programming
- Dancing bachata and salsa for competitions
- Working on tutorial for "How to start to invest for dummies"

These are my main priorities right now.

- Be a better dancer
- Improving my daily habits
- Be a profitable trader
- Understand how to delegate and make better decisions on the work
- Doing more in less time

If my activities or priorities happen to change, I’ll update this page to reflect those changes. The last update was on December 18, 2023.

This page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself, and it balances out the goal-driven nature of my [Impossible List](/now/). It was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now) and [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/now/).
