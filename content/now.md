I´m in Monterrey, Nuevo León, dancer, trader and web developer.

This is what I spend my time doing:

- Trading
- Learning about blockchain
- Writing on my [blog](https://fercontreras.com)
- [Reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/fercreek)
- Programming

These are my main priorities right now.

- Be a profitable trader
- Improving my dialy habits
- Doing more in less time

If my activities or priorities happen to change, I’ll update this page to reflect those changes. The last update was on January 23, 2021.

This page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself, and it balances out the goal-driven nature of my [Impossible List](/now/). It was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now) and [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/now/).
