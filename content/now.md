What I Am Doing Now
I´m in Monterrey, Nuevo León, learning to dance bachata and salsa. Improving my knowledge in Ruby, Python, and Golang.

This is what I spend my time doing:

- Power building
- Taking bachata and salsa lessons
- Writing on my [blog](https://fercontreras.com)
- [Reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/fercreek)
- Eating better and being healthy

These are my main priorities right now.

- Improving my dialy habits
- Deep understanding of Ruby and Golang

If my activities or priorities happen to change, I’ll update this page to reflect those changes. The last update was on March 28, 2019.

This page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself, and it balances out the goal-driven nature of my [Impossible List](/now/). It was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now) and [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/now/).
