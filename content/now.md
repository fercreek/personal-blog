I´m in Monterrey, Nuevo León, learning about cryptocurrencies, investment, and data analytics.

This is what I spend my time doing:

- Learning about blockchain and investment
- [Reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/fercreek)
- Watchingtendencias videos about cryptocurrencies and trends

These are my main priorities right now.

- Understand how to delegate and make better decisions on the work
- Improving my daily habits
- Be effective and productive

If my activities or priorities happen to change, I’ll update this page to reflect those changes. The last update was on May 17, 2020.

This page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself, and it balances out the goal-driven nature of my [Impossible List](/now/). It was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now) and [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/now/).
