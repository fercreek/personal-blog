Currently residing in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, I am immersing myself in the world of cryptocurrencies, investment, and data analytics.

Here's a snapshot of my current activities:

- Developing my own products
- Training in bachata and salsa for dance competitions

These are my primary focuses at the moment:

- Enhancing my dance skills
- Refining my daily habits
- Becoming a profitable trader
- Learning to delegate effectively and make informed decisions at work
- Increasing productivity to achieve more in less time

This page will be updated to reflect any changes in my activities or priorities. The last update was on February 24, 2025.

This page serves as a public declaration and a personal reminder, providing a balance to the goal-oriented nature of my [Impossible List](/now/). This concept was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now) and [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/now/).
