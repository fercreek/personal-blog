title: "What I Am Doing Now"

I'm in Monterrey, Nuevo León, learning about cryptocurrencies, investment, and data analytics.

This is what I spend my time doing:

- Learning about blockchain and investment
- Writing on my [blog](https://fercontreras.com)
- [Reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/fercreek)
- Programming
- Dancing bachata and salsa for competitions

These are my main priorities right now.

- Be a profitable trader
- Improving my dialy habits
- Understand how to delegate and make better decisions on the work
- Doing more in less time

If my activities or priorities happen to change, I’ll update this page to reflect those changes. The last update was on March 7, 2022.

This page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself, and it balances out the goal-driven nature of my [Impossible List](/now/). It was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now) and [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/now/).
